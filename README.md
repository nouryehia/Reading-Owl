# Reading Owl

## Site

You can access the *Reading Owl* site by clicking [here](https://www.reading-owl.com). To explore all of its feature, I recommend you sign up :)

## Disclaimer

The website is currently undergoing a major (major!) rewrite, which is why the source code is not currently publically available. Turns out a PHP backend and an HTML/CSS frontend was a somewhat naive way to go about web development. The source code will be made available once the rewrite is done.

## Overview

*Reading Owl* is the result of a Computer Science major student (that very much enjoys reading) staying home and refining his web development skills. More seriously, it is a website that allows people to search, explore, and review books. I use the Google Books API to search for books and retrieve information about them and the NY Times API to display a list of Best Sellers. User information, book details, reviews, etc. are stored in a MySQL database. AWS Lightsail is used to host the website.
